In this project, I employed Vue.js as the front-end JavaScript framework to enhance user interaction.
To manage data interactions, I designed and integrated a custom dataset using web APIs. Vue.js efficiently rendered and displayed it, exploiting its reactive components for a dynamic user interface.
This dataset served as a crucial link between the front-end components and backend services, enabling smooth data flow.
This approach optimized both user experience and data handling in the application.
